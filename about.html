        To ensure that we would use proper and different types of semantic tags we first made a word document where we put all the text we needed for the different pages of our website.
        From there, we already then also wrote the semantic tags we knew we needed, as well as looking into different sematic tags, which we did not know much about.
        We read into their usability to be more confident we did not used them wrongfully. 
        Furthermove, we also added the pictures used for the website to the word document, before piecing everything together in <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSC.</abbr>
    
        Since this is our first website, we are not that certain that we were able to use the HTML in a way that we could annotate all the different parts of our content in the best way possible. 
        It will be interesting to see what we can improve upon until the next time.
        Thanks for checking out or website, any criticism will help alot!
