            <figcaption><u>The Sun Temple</u> <br>
                This is an image of a structure that me and my team built in minecraft.<br> 
                This project was meant to show the different sides of our world together with "Castle on the Hill".<br>
                Together with the team we worked hard to express the beauty of different structures from different time periods.<br>
                It was enlightening working with people who had a lot of different ideas. With "The Sun Temple" we emphasized the pointy roofs of traditional japanese temples.

            <figcaption><u>Backstreet of Kyoto</u><br>
            This was a project intended to capture the back alleys and the not so visited areas of Kyoto.<br> 
            This was a really fascinating project where I learned alot about perspectives. <br>
            How I view something may differ from what others see. <br>
            While my group was walking and taking pictures of these alleys in Kyoto, we all looked for something different from one another. <br>
            Both the task itself and the pictures we took was interpred differently and it helped me realize that one can look at the same thing from different sides. <br>
            I am now more skilled at being able to identify different approaches to the same problem, and able to switch to the more effective one.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><u>Castle on the Hill</u><br>
            As with "The Sun Temple" this project was intended to show some of the different sides <br>
            and cultures of the world. "Castle on the Hill" had many different iterations, <br> 
            but in the end we ended up going for a small castle. This was a caricature to the grand castles</figcaption>
